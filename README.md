# IH-rack-addon
An addon for Iron Horse NewGRF for OpenTTD game.

# Usage:
*Track building: Between regular and rack there needs to be transition at least two tiles longer than your longest train... This is so IH locos can stop being powered when our "loco" grabs power
*Train creation: Sadly the rack compatibility "loco" is not in regular depot, but conversion of regular one to rack one and vice versa works.
*The Useless loco is really useless for gameplay but enables the transition track.
